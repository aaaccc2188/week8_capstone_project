![Logo](Images/image.jpg)

## **Background**
- Impact Investing, aka Sustainable/Responsible/ESG Investing, seeks to deliver competitive financial returns while driving positive environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes. Over the past few years, impact investing has gained significant momentum among asset managers; it now accounts for more than one-fourth of total assets under management (AUM) in the U.S., with AUM growing to $12 trillion, up 38% from the start of 2016 to the start of 2018. Total assets in sustainable investing exceeded $30 trillion globally at the start of 2018, with institutions accounting for 75% of the total.

- Yet there are few outlets that exist to address retail investors' needs. As shown before, only 25% of AUM was from retail. As demographics shift, we believe the new generation of retail investors, who are already showing strong preferences and willing to pay a premium for the green and sustainable product (i.e. vegetarian burgers, electronic vehicles), have unfilled needs to help them identify and measure ESG investments. Just as Robhinhood has democratized investing, we're creating a product to democratize impact investing for all.
